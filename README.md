# 2018 PIMS BC Data Science Workshop

This is a workshop I worked on in June 2018. Our team's project is Comm100: Determining intent and automating knowledge base creation from live chat transcripts. Detailed project information and my delivery can be access under the "4-comm100" folder. 



## Description

This repository contains workshop content and resources for the 2018 BC
Data Science Workshop hosted by PIMS. Please see below for links relevant to
each team.

## About

Approximately fifty workshop participants comprise students affiliated with PIMS
institutions or local industry, forming five teams. Each team will have five
days to tackle an innovation challenge provided by an industry mentor:

* SSR Mining
* St. Paul's Hospital
* SNC-Lavalin
* Comm100
* CloudPBX

### Notes on the computing resources

Participants will be given a partition the
[bcdata.syzygy.ca](https://bcdata.syzygy.ca) Jupyter Hub, courtesy of PIMS (and
thanks to Ian Allison). You will see on this partition a `data` directory which
houses this repository as well as the workshop data from the industry
mentors. This directory is read only, but the repository [in general] is not:
you can [download your own local
copy](https://github.com/bcdataca/workshop-content18) to `~/` on your partition
and alter content as you please.

Each partition has a 20 GB local disk quota (please do not exceed
this). Computational resources are shared amongst participants - if you have a
large/expensive computation to perform, the best time to do it is in the morning
or at night. Please note that if a job is taking up excessive amounts of
computing space then the process may have to be killed to allow all participants
fair access to the computing resources. 

## Projects

1. [Predicting heavy equipment failure](./1-ssr/)
2. [Connecting genetic mutations to cytokine levels](./2-stpaul/)
3. [Interpolating ship paths in the Port of Metro Vancouver](./3-snc/)
4. [Determining intent and automating knowledge base creation from live chat transcripts](./4-comm100/)
5. [Analyzing user opinion of call quality, and network performance of a VoIP PBX](./5-cloudpbx/)

## Links

Please visit the [workshop website](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2018) for
information, schedules and resources. The [full
schedule](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2018/talk/full-schedule) has updated room
assignments.

This repository also contains a [resources](./resources.md) document for
individuals who might need a refresher on GitHub, scikit-learn, pandas, nltk,
tidyverse, dplyr or bash. The document also contains some project-specific
resources for loading and formatting particular file types (like genetic data);
and resources for running specific technical methods that might be useful in
solving the projects.

The computing Hub for this workshop is accessible to participants at
[bcdata.syzygy.ca](https://bcdata.syzygy.ca). Login requires a [GitHub
handle](https://github.com). Information on how to acquire this handle can be
found in the [resources document](./resources.md).
